		<description><![CDATA[Further to my comment of 11 December 2013,  I ought to clarify my observation  about the inability of e being replaced by any other value.  I now consider that  it is possible for e to be replaced by other values but only because the general formula for any variable base n and power u should be the 
constant n^(u/logn).  When n equals e,  log n will be clearly 1.   The fact that n^(t/logn) has to be a constant particularly when applied to i that is n^(ti/logn)  undermines virtually all the arguments in Riemann&#039;s 1859 paper.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cotes&#039;s fomula can be constructed by bringing together the infinite series for sines, the infinite series for cosines and the infinite series for antilog e discovered by Isaac Newton in his epistola posterior 1676.  The inability of e to be replaced by any other value when it has a complex power is my own invention.  As also is the fact that the coefficient of i has to be an angle.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be indeed interested to read this - I hope you will keep me posted? Particularly interesting would be to hear about Cotes&#039;s formula since I couldn&#039;t find any reference to this whatsoever. Is there any chance you can give us a preview on this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unlike the individuals referred to in Marcus Schepke&#039;s comment, I am not and never have been a professional academic.  This means that I can reach conclusions based on mathematical rules such as Cotes&#039;s formula which the professionals have overlooked and certainly not scrutinised.  I have done something similar to Fermat&#039;s Last Theorem but this takes just over 400 words, and should be published In April 2014.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice to read a comment here, though I fail to follow through as well as to see the connection to this particular post, particularly since every statement of Riemann&#039;s paper has been thoroughly scrutinised and (save the RH) rigorously proved afterwards. Can you elaborate?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Near the beginning of his 1859 paper Riemann incorrectly assumes that the complex variable s =(1/2) + ti is a zeta power.  Riemann fails to recognise that an expression containing an imaginary number such as (1/2) + ti cannot be a power unless the base is a log base such as e.  The best known example of this is Cotes&#039;s formula (not mentioned by Riemann), cosu + isinu equals e^(iu),  where it is not possible for e to be meaningfully replaced by other values,  also e^(1/2) X e^(iu) equals e^[(1/2) +iu].  This means that Riemann is badly wrong in applying as a power s = (1/2) +ti and in failing to recognise t as an angle.  It also means that practically all the arguments in his 1859 paper are fallacious.]]></description>
